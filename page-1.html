		<h2>Off on a Comet</h2>
		<h3>by Jules Verne</h3>
		<h4>Introduction to the story</h4>
		<p>AMONG so many effective and artistic tales of our author, it is difficult to give a prefer- ence to one over all the rest. Yet, certainly, even amid Verne's most remarkable works, his "Off on a Comet" must be given high rank. Perhaps this story will
			be remembered when some of his greatest efforts have been obliterated by centuries of time. At least, of the many books since written upon the same theme as Verne's, no one has yet equaled or even approached it.</p>
		<p>In one way "Off on a Comet" shows a marked contrast to Verne's earlier books. Not only does it invade a region of remotest space, but the author here abandons his usual scrupidously scientific attitude and gives his fancy freer rein. In order that he
			may escort us through the depths of immeasur- able space, to show us what astronomy really knoius of conditions there and upon the other planets, Verne asks us to accept a situation which is in a sense self-contradictory. The earth and a comet are
			brought twice into collision without mankind in gen- eral, or even our astronomers, becoming conscious of the fact. Moreover several people from widely scattered places are carried off by the comet and returned uninjured. Yet further, the comet snatch-
			es and carries a way with it for the convenience of its travelers, both air and water. Little, useful tracts of earth are picked up and, as it were, turned over and clapped down right side up again upon the comet's surface. Even ships pass uninjured
			through this remarkable somersault. These events all belong to the realm of fairyland.</p>
		<p>If the situation were reproduced in actuality, if, ever a comet should come into collision with the earth, we can conceive two scientifically possible results. If the comet were of such attenuation, such almost infinitesimal mass as some of these celestial
			wanderers seem to be, we can imagine our earth self- protective and possibly unharmed. If, on the other hand, the comet had even a hundredth part of the size and solidity and weight which Verne confers upon his monster so as to give his travelers a
			home in that case the collision woidd be unspeakably disastrous - especially to the unlucky individuals who occupied the exact point of contact.</p>
		<p>But once granted the initial and the closing ex- travagance, the departure and return of his charac- ters, the alpha and omega of his tale, hoxo closely the author clings to facts between! How closely he fol- lows, and imparts to his readers, the scientific
			proba- bilities of the universe beyond our earth, the actual knoivledge so hard won by our astronomers! Other authors who, since Verne, have told of trips through the planetary and stellar universe have given free rein to fancy, to dreams of what might
			be found. Verne has endeavored to impart only what is known to exist.</p>
		<p>In the same year with "Off on a Comet," 1877, was published also the tale variously named and trans- lated as "The Black Indies," "The Underground City" and "The Child of the Cavern," This story, like "Round the World in Eighty Days" was first issued
			in "feuilleton" by the noted Paris newspaper "Le Temps." Its success did not equal that of its predecessor in this style. Some critics indeed have pointed to this work as marking the beginning of a decline in the author's pou'er of awaking interest.
			Many of his best works were, however, still to follow.</p>

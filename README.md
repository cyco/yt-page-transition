# yt-page-transition
Weekend project to figure out how to do smooth page transitions youtube-style.

## Demo
Check out these few demo pages to see it in action: [cyco.github.io/yt-page-transition/page-1.html](https://cyco.github.io/yt-page-transition/page-1.html)

## Installation / Usage
Check out the project and start the project using yarn or npm:

```bash
cd yt-page-transition
yarn start
```
The command will start a webserver on port `8080` that adds a random delay between 300ms and 1.3s before serving a file.

## Credits
The base styles for the demo pages were taken from [bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com) and the texts have been archived by [pulpmags.org](https://www.pulpmags.org). Awesome projects. Thanks for your work üëç!
